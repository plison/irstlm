HOW TO INSTALL

1. Run the following commandsi
# set parameter force to the value "--force" if you want to recreate all links to the autotools
step 0: sh regenerate-makefiles.sh [--force]

# run "configure --help" to get more details on the compilation options
step 1: ./configure [--prefix=/path/where/to/install] [--enable-caching] [--enable-profiling] [--enable-doc] [--disable-trace] [--disable-debugging] 

step 2: make

step 3: make install

It will generate the irstlm library and commands, respectively,
under the directories PREFIX/lib and PREFIX/bin.

If enabled and PdfLatex is installed, it will generate 
the user manual (in pdf) under the directory ./doc

Although caching is not enabled by default, it is highly recommended
to activate through its compilation flag (--enable-caching).
