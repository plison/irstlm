in the last weekend snowfalls , still ongoing , added on average 30 - 40 cm of fresh snow at 1800 m , with up to 60 cm on the Canin range .
the fresh snow does not bind perfectly with the underlying layers .
at high elevations , the snowpack has been drifted by the wind and formed conspicuous accumulations on all sides and especially on northern ones .
the snowpack is not settled yet , especially above the tree line .
hence , avalanches of snow and slabs may be released naturally in avalanche - prone areas .
the discharge of mid-sized slabs may be triggered also by a light load and below the tree line .
