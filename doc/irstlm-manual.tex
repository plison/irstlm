\section{Introduction}

This manual illustrates the functionalities of  the IRST Language  Modeling (LM)  toolkit ({\IRSTLM}). It  should  
put you quickly  in  the condition of:
\begin{itemize}
\item extracting the dictionary from a corpus
\item extracting n-gram statistics from it
\item estimating n-gram LMs using different smoothing criteria
\item estimating and handling gigantic LMs
\item adapting a LM on specific application data
\item saving a  LM into a compact binary file
\item pruning a LM
\item reducing LM size through quantization
\item querying a LM through a command or script
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Among  state-of-the-art  $n$-gram  smoothing  techniques, {\IRSTLM} features LM  very efficient 
data structures to handle very large LMs and adaptation  methods which  can  be effective when limited task-related  data are available. 

{\IRSTLM} features algorithms and data structures suitable to estimate, 
store, and access very  large LMs.  Our software has been integrated into a popular open source 
SMT decoder  called {\tt Moses}\footnote{http://www.statmt.org/moses/}, and is compatible with LMs
created with other tools, such as the SRILM Tooolkit\footnote{http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm}

%% GETTING STARTED %%%%

\newpage
\section{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}

\IMPORTANT{The installation procedure has been tested using the {\tt bash} shell on the following operating systems: Mac OSx 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty), Scientific Linux release 6.3 (carbon).}

\noindent In order to install {\IRSTLM} on your machine, please perform the following steps.


\subsection{Step 0: preparation of the configuration}
\begin{verbatim}
$> ./regenerate-makefiles.sh [--force]
\end{verbatim}

\WARNING{Run with the "--force" parameter if you want to recreate all links to the autotools.}

\subsection{Step 1: configuration of the compilation}
\begin{verbatim}
$> ./configure [--prefix=/path/to/install]
               [--enable-caching] 
               [--enable-profiling]
               [--enable-doc]
               [--disable-trace]
               [--disable-debugging]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Run the following command to get more details on the compilation options.
\begin{verbatim}
$> configure --help
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 2: Compilation}

\begin{verbatim}
$> make clean
$> make
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 3: Installation}
\begin{verbatim}
$> make install
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Libraries and commands are generated,  respectively, under the directories\newline {\tt /path/to/install/lib} and {\tt /path/to/install/bin}.

\noindent
If enabled and PdfLatex is installed, this user manual (in pdf) is generated under the directory\newline {\tt /path/to/install/doc}.

\noindent
Although caching is not enabled by default, it is highly recommended to activate through its compilation flag "{\tt --enable-caching}".


\subsection{Step 4: Environment Settings}
Set the environment variable {\tt IRSTLM} to {\tt /path/to/install}.

\noindent
Include the command directory {\tt /path/to/install/bin} into your environment variable {\tt PATH}.
For instance, you can run the following commands

\begin{verbatim}
$> export IRSTLM=/path/to/install/
$> export PATH=${IRSTLM/bin:${PATH}
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\section{Getting started}
After a successful installation, you are ready to use {\IRSTLM}.

\noindent
Data sets used in the following usage examples can be found in an archive you can download from the official website of {\IRSTLM}.


\IMPORTANT{All programs assume that the environment variable {\bf IRSTLM} is correctly set to {\tt /path/to/install/doc}, and that that environment variable {\bf PATH} includes the command directory {\tt /path/to/install/bin}. see above}


\paragraph{Preparation of Training Data}
In order to estimate a Language Model, you first need to prepare your training corpus. The corpus just consists of a text.
We assume that the text is already preprocessed according to the user needs; this means that lowercasing, uppercasing, tokenization, and any other text transformation has to be performed beforehand with other tools.

\noindent
You can only decide whether you are interested that {\IRSTLM} is aware
of sentence boundaries, i.e. where a sentence starts and ends. Otherwise,
the toolkit considers the corpus as a continuous stream of text, and does
not identify sentence splits.  The following script adds start and end
symbols ({\tt <s>} and {\tt </s>}, respectively) to all lines in your training corpus.
\begin{verbatim}
$> add-start-end.sh < your-text-file 
\end{verbatim}

\IMPORTANT{{\IRSTLM} assumes that each line corresponds to a sentence, regardless the presence of punctuation inside or at the end of the line.}
\IMPORTANT{Start and end symbols ({\tt <s>} and {\tt </s>}) should be considered reserved symbols, and used only as sentence boundaries.}

\noindent
{\IRSTLM} does not compute probabilities for cross-sentence $n$-grams, i.e. $n$-grams including the pair {\tt </s>  <s>}.


\paragraph{Training our first LM}
\noindent
We  are now ready to estimate a  3-gram (trigram)  LM by  running the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr="gunzip -c train.gz" -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
which produces the output:
\begin{verbatim}
n=49984 LP=301734.5406 PP=418.4772517 OOVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The output shows the number of  words in the test set, the LM log-probability, the LM perplexity  
and the out-of-vocabulary rate  of the test set.

\noindent
If you need  to train and test different language  models on the same data, a  more efficient 
way to  proceed is to first  create an $n$-gram table of the training data:
\begin{verbatim}
$> ngt -i="gunzip -c train.gz" -n=3 -o=train.www -b=yes
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The command {\tt ngt} reads an  input text file, creates an  $n$-gram table of specified size ({\tt -n=3}), and 
saves it in binary format ({\tt -b=yes}) into a specified output file.

\noindent
Now,  the  LM can  be  estimated and evaluated more quickly:
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Once  estimated, a  LM can  be also saved in the standard ARPA text format:
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb  -o=train.lm
\end{verbatim}
or in a binary format 
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb  -obin=train.blm
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
(Remark: the  binary format formerly used by the IRST speech recognizer is still available, through the option
{\tt -oasr <filename>}, but is no more supported.)

\newpage
\section{More on ngt}
Given a text corpus we can compute its dictionary and word frequencies
with the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> dict -i="gunzip -c train.gz" -o=train.dict -f=yes
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
For speech recognition applications, it  can be often the case to limit the LM dictionary  only to the top frequent, let us say,
10K words. We can obtain such a list by:
\begin{verbatim}
$> dict -i="gunzip -c train.gz" -o=top10k -pr=10000
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
{\bf Notice}: the list will also include the start/end-sentence symbols.\\

\noindent
An alternative pruning strategy is to filter out words occurring less or equal than a specified 
count. The following example removes the word occurring $\le$ 5 times and keeps
the top frequent 10K (at most) of the others:
\begin{verbatim}
$> dict -i="gunzip -c train.gz" -o=top10k5f -pr=10000 -pf=5
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
Statistics about the frequency of words inside a corpus can be gathered through  the command {\tt dict}
with the option {\tt -curve=yes}, while out-of-vocabulary rate statistics over a test set can be computed with
the option {\tt -TestFile=<sample>}.  The following example illustrates both features:
\begin{verbatim}
$> dict -i="gunzip -c train.gz"  -Curve=yes -TestFile=test

**************** DICTIONARY GROWTH CURVE ****************
Freq    Entries Percent       Freq    OOV onTest
>0      15058    100.00%      <1        5.01%
>1      10113     67.16%      <2        7.64%
>2      8057      53.51%      <3        8.89%
>3      6948      46.14%      <4        9.96%
>4      6207      41.22%      <5       10.72%
>5      5644      37.48%      <6       11.67%
>6      5205      34.57%      <7       12.18%
>7      4823      32.03%      <8       12.72%
>8      4523      30.04%      <9       13.47%
>9      4224      28.05%      <10      14.10%
*********************************************************

\end{verbatim}

\noindent
A new  $n$-gram table for the  limited dictionary can  be computed with {\tt ngt} by specifying 
the sub-dictionary:
\begin{verbatim}
$> ngt -i=train.www -sd=top10k -n=3 -o=train.10k.www -b=yes
\end{verbatim}
The command replaces  all words outside  top10K with  the special
out-of-vocabulary symbol {\tt \_unk\_}.

\noindent
Another useful feature of ngt is the merging of two $n$-gram tables. Assume that we have 
split our training corpus into files  {\tt text-a} and file {\tt text-b} and have computed $n$-gram 
tables for both files, we can merge them with the option {\tt -aug}:
\begin{verbatim}
$> ngt -i="gunzip -c text-a.gz" -n=3 -o=text-a.www -b=yes
$> ngt -i="gunzip -c text-b.gz" -n=3 -o=text-b.www -b=yes
$> ngt -i=text-a.www -aug=text-b.www -n=3 -o=text.www -b=yes
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Warning:} Note that if the concatenation of {\tt text-a.gz} and {\tt text-b.gz} is equal to {\tt train.gz} the resulting $n$-gram tables
{\tt text.www} and {\tt train.www} can slightly differ. This happens because during the construction of each single $n$-gram table few $n$-grams are automatically added to make it consistent for further computation.


%% MORE ON TLM %%%%
\newpage
\section{More on tlm}
Language models have to  cope with out-of-vocabulary words, that is internally represented
with the word class  {\tt \_unk\_}.  In order  to
compare perplexity of LMs having  different vocabulary size it is better
to define  a conventional dictionary  size, or dictionary  upper bound
size,  trough the  parameter  ({\tt -dub}).  In  the  following example,  we
compare the perplexity of the full vocabulary LM against the perplexity of the
LM estimated over the more frequent 10K-words. In our comparison, we assume a dictionary 
upper bound of one million words.

\begin{verbatim}
$>tlm -tr=train.10k.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -dub=1000000
  n=49984 LP=342160.8721 PP=939.5565162 OVVRate=0.07666453265

$>tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -dub=1000000
  n=49984 LP=336276.7842 PP=835.2144716 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
The  large  difference  in  perplexity  between the two LMs is   explained  by  the 
significantly higher  OOV rate of the 10K-word LM.

\noindent
N-gram LMs generally apply frequency smoothing techniques, and combine
smoothed frequencies according to  two main schemes: interpolation and
back-off.  The  toolkit assumes interpolation
as default.  The back-off  scheme is computationally more costly but
often provides better performance. It  can be activated with the option
{\tt -bo=yes}, e.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
$>tlm -tr=train.10k.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -dub=1000000 -bo=yes
  n=49984 LP=337278.3227 PP=852.1186066 OVVRate=0.07666453265
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
This toolkit implements several frequency smoothing methods, which are
specified  by  the  parameter  {\tt -lm}.  Three  methods  are  particularly
recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] {\bf Modified shift-beta}, also known as  ``improved kneser-ney smoothing''.  
This smoothing scheme gives top performance when training data is not 
very sparse but it is more time and memory consuming during the estimation phase: 

\begin{verbatim}
$>tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=msb -te=test -dub=1000000 -bo=yes
  n=49984 LP=321877.3411 PP=626.1609806 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}


\item [b)] {\bf Witten Bell smoothing}. This is an excellent smoothing
   method which works well in every data condition and is much less time and memory consuming:

\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -dub=1000000  -bo=yes
  n=49984 LP=331577.2279 PP=760.2652095 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}

\item [c)] {\bf Shift-beta smoothing}. This smoothing method is a simpler and cheaper version
of the Modified shift-beta method and works sometimes better than Witten-Bell method: 

\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=sb -te=test -dub=1000000  -bo=yes
  n=49984 LP=334724.5032 PP=809.6750442 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Moreover, the non linear smoothing parameter $\beta$ can be specified with the option {\tt -beta}:
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=sb -beta=0.001 -te=test -dub=1000000  
       -bo=yes
  n=49984 LP=449339.8282 PP=8019.836058 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}
This could be helpful in case we need to use language models with very limited frequency smoothing.

\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Limited Vocabulary}
\noindent
Using an  n-gram table  with a fixed  or limited  dictionary  will cause
some performance  degradation, as LM smoothing  statistics result
slightly distorted. A  valid alternative is to estimate  the LM on the
full dictionary of the training corpus and to use a limited dictionary
just when  saving the  LM on a  file.  This  can be achieved  with the
option {\tt -d} (or {\tt -dictionary}):
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=msb -bo=y -te=test -o=train.lm -d=top10k
\end{verbatim}

%% LM ADAPTATION %%%%
\newpage
\section{LM Adaptation}
Language model adaptation can be  applied when little training data is given for the 
task at hand, but much more data from other less related sources is available.  {\tt tlm} supports two adaptation methods.

\subsection{Minimum Discriminative Information Adaptation}
MDI adaptation  is used  when domain related  data is very  little but
enough to  estimate a  unigram LM.  Basically,  the n-gram probs  of a
general  purpose (background)  LM are  scaled so  that they  match the
target unigram distribution.
	
\noindent	 
Relevant parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt -ar=value}: the adaptation {\tt rate},  a real number ranging 
 from 0 (=no adaptation) to 1 (=strong adaptation).

\item {\tt -ad=file}: the  adaptation file,  either a text  or a
  unigram table.

\item {\tt -ao=y}: open vocabulary mode, which  must be set if the adaptation file
 might contain new words to be added to the basic dictionary.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As an example, we apply MDI adaptation on the ``adapt'' file:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -lm=wb -n=3 -te=test -dub=1000000 -ad=adapt -ar=0.8 -ao=yes
   n=49984 LP=326327.8053 PP=684.470312 OVVRate=0.04193341869
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent
\paragraph{Warning:}  modified shift-beta  smoothing  cannot  be applied  in  open
vocabulary mode  ({\tt -ao=yes}).  If  this is the  case, you  should either
change  smoothing method  or simply  add  the adaptation  text to  the
background LM (use {\tt -aug} parameter  of {\tt ngt}). In
general, this solution should  provide better performance.
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
$> ngt -i=train.www -aug=adapt -o=train-adapt.www -n=3 -b=yes
$> tlm -tr=train-adapt.www -lm=msb -n=3 -te=test -dub=1000000 -ad=adapt -ar=0.8
  n=49984 LP=312276.1746 PP=516.7311396 OVVRate=0.04193341869
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{Mixture Adaptation}

\noindent
Mixture adaptation  is useful  when you have  enough training  data to
estimate a  bigram or  trigram LM and  you also have  data collections
from other domains.

\noindent
Relevant parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt-lm=mix} : specifies mixture smoothing method
\item {\tt -slmi=<filename>}: specifies filename with information about LMs to combine.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In the example directory, the file {\tt sublmi} contains the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
2
-slm=msb -str=adapt -sp=0
-slm=msb -str=train.www -sp=0
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
This means  that we use train a  mixture model on the  {\tt adapt} data set and
combine it  with the train data. For each data  set the desired
smoothing method is specified  (disregard the parameter {\tt -sp}). The file
used for adaptation is the one in FIRST position.

\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -lm=mix -slmi=sublm -n=3 -te=test -dub=1000000
  n=49984 LP=307199.3273 PP=466.8244383 OVVRate=0.04193341869
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
{\bf Warning}: for  computational reasons it  is expected that  the $n$-gram
table  specified by {\tt -tr}  contains AT  LEAST the  $n$-grams of  the last
table specified in the slmi file, i.e. {\tt train.www} in  the example.
Faster computations are achieved by putting the largest dataset as the
last sub-model in the list and the union of all data sets as training
file.

\noindent
It is  also IMPORTANT  that a  large {\tt -dub} value  is specified  so that
probabilities  of  sub-LMs  can  be  correctly  computed  in  case  of
out-of-vocabulary words.

%% ESTIMATING GIGANTIC LMs %%%%
\newpage
\section{Estimating Gigantic LMs}
\label{sec:giganticLM}
LM estimation starts with the collection of n-grams and their frequency counters. Then, 
smoothing parameters are estimated for each n-gram level; infrequent n-grams are
possibly pruned and, finally, a LM file is created containing n-grams with probabilities and 
back-off weights.  This procedure can be very demanding in terms of memory and
time if it applied on huge corpora.   We provide here a way to split LM training  into smaller and independent steps, that can be easily distributed among independent processes. The  
procedure relies on a training scripts that makes little use of computer RAM and implements 
the  Witten-Bell smoothing method in an exact way.  

\noindent
Before starting, let us create a working directory under {\tt examples}, as many files will be created:

\begin{verbatim}
$> mkdir stat
\end{verbatim}

The script to generate the LM is:

\begin{verbatim}
$> build-lm.sh -i "gunzip -c train.gz" -n 3  -o train.ilm.gz -k 5
\end{verbatim}
where the available options are:

\begin{verbatim}
-i    Input training file e.g. 'gunzip -c train.gz'
-o    Output gzipped LM, e.g. lm.gz
-k    Number of splits (default 5)
-n    Order of language model (default 3)
-t    Directory for temporary files (default ./stat)
-p    Prune singleton n-grams (default false)
-s    Smoothing: witten-bell (default), kneser-ney, improved-kneser-ney 
-b    Include sentence boundary n-grams (optional)
-d    Define subdictionary for n-grams (optional)
-v    Verbose
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The script splits the estimation procedure into 5 distinct jobs, that are explained in
the following section. There are other options that can be used. We recommend for instance to use pruning of singletons to get smaller LM files. 
Notice that {\tt build-lm.sh} produces a LM file {\tt train.ilm.gz} that is NOT in the final ARPA format, but in
an intermediate format called {\tt iARPA}, that is recognized by the {\tt compile-lm} 
command and by the Moses SMT decoder running with {\IRSTLM}. 
To convert the file into the standard ARPA format you can use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.ilm.gz --text yes train.lm 
\end{verbatim}
this will create the proper ARPA file {\tt lm-final}.
To create a gzipped file you might also use:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.ilm.gz --text yes /dev/stdout | gzip -c > train.lm.gz
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
In the following sections, we will discuss on LM file formats, on compiling LMs into a 
more compact and efficient binary format, and on querying LMs.

\subsection{Estimating a LM with a Partial Dictionary}

A sub-dictionary can be defined by just taking words occurring more than 5 times ({\tt -pf=5})
and at most the top frequent 5000 words ({\tt -pr=5000}):
\begin{verbatim}
$>dict -i="gunzip -c train.gz" -o=sdict -pr=5000 -pf=5 
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
The LM can be restricted to the defined sub-dictionary with the 
command {\tt build-lm.sh} by using the option {\tt -d}: 
\begin{verbatim}
$> build-lm.sh -i "gunzip -c train.gz" -n 3  -o  train.ilm.gz -k 5 -p -d sdict 
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Notice that all words outside the sub-dictionary will be mapped into the {\tt <unk>}
class, the probability of which will be directly estimated from the corpus statistics.
A preferable alternative to this approach is to estimate a large LM and then to filter
it according to a list of words (see Filtering a LM).


%%%% LM FORMATS %%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{LM File Formats}
The toolkit supports three output format of LMs. These formats have the
purpose of permitting  the use of LMs by  external programs.  External
programs could in principle estimate the LM from an $n$-gram table before
using it, but this would take much more time and memory! So the best thing
to do is to first  estimate the LM, and then compile it into a binary format   
that is more compact and that can be quickly loaded and queried by the 
external program.


\subsection{ARPA Format}
This format was  introduced in DARPA ASR evaluations  to exchange LMs.
ARPA format  is also  supported by the  SRI LM  Toolkit. It is  a text
format which is rather costly in terms of memory. There is no limit to
the size $n$ of $n$-grams.

\subsection{qARPA Format}
This extends the ARPA format by including codebooks that quantize 
probabilities and back-off weights of each $n$-gram level. This format
is created through the command {\tt quantize-lm}.

\subsection{iARPA Format}
This is an intermediate ARPA format in the sense that each entry of the file
does not contain in the first position the full $n$-gram probability, but just its
smoothed frequency, i.e.:\\
\noindent
{\tt ...\\
f(z|x y) x y z bow(x y)\\
...
}

\noindent
This format is nevertheless properly managed by the {\tt compile-lm} command
in order to generate a binary version or a correct ARPA version.


\subsection{Binary Formats}
Both ARPA and qARPA formats can be converted into a binary format 
that allows for space savings on disk and a much quicker upload of
the LM file.  Binary versions can be created with the command 
{\tt compile-lm}, that produces files with  headers {\tt blmt} or {\tt Qblmt}.

\noindent
Moreover, for an even faster access you can store the ngrams in an inverted
order (see Section~\ref{sec:inverted-lm});
the files with inverted-ordered ngrams have headers  {\tt blmtI} or {\tt QblmtI}.

%%%% LM QUANTIZATION & COMPILATION %%%%%
\newpage
\section{LM Pruning}
Large LMs files can be pruned in a smart way by means of the command 
{\tt prune-lm} that removes $n$-grams for which resorting to the back-off 
results in a small loss. {\IRSTLM} implements a method similar to the 
Weighted Difference Method described in the paper {\em Scalable Backoff
Language Models} by Seymore and Rosenfeld.

\noindent
The syntax is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
$> prune-lm --threshold=1e-6,1e-6  train.lm.gz  train.plm
\end{verbatim}
Thresholds for each n-gram level, up from 2-grams, are based on empirical 
evidence. Threshold zero results in no pruning. If less thresholds are specified,
the right most is applied to the higher levels. Hence, in the above example we
could have just specified one threshold, namely {\tt --threshold=1e-6}. 
The effect of pruning is shown in the following messages of {\tt prune-lm}:

\begin{verbatim}1-grams: reading 15059 entries
2-grams: reading 142684 entries
3-grams: reading 293685 entries
done
OOV code is 15058
OOV code is 15058
pruning LM with thresholds: 
 1e-06 1e-06
savetxt: train.plm
save: 15059 1-grams
save: 138252 2-grams
save: 194194 3-grams
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The saved LM table {\tt train.plm}  contains about 3\% less bigrams, and 34\%  
less trigrams.
Notice that the output of prune-lm is an ARPA LM file, while the input can be 
either an ARPA or binary LM. 
In order to measure the loss in accuracy introduced
by pruning, perplexity of the resulting LM can be computed (see below).

\paragraph{Warning:} the possible quantization should be performed after pruning.

\paragraph{Warning:} 
{\IRSTLM} does not provide a reliable probability for the special
1-gram composed by the ``sentence start symbol'' ({\tt <s>}) , because none
should ever ask for it.  However, this pruning method requires the
computation of the probability of this 1-gram.  Hence, (only) in this case
the probability of this special 1-gram is arbitrarily set to 1.

\newpage
\section{LM Quantization}
A language model file in ARPA  format, created with the IRST LM toolkit or
with other tools, can be quantized and stored in a compact data structure, 
called language model table.  Quantization can be performed by the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> quantize-lm  train.lm train.qlm
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
which  generates   the  quantized  version  {\tt train.qlm} that  encodes all probabilities and back-off 
weights in 8 bits. The  output is a  modified ARPA format, called qARPA. Notice that quantized
LMs reduce memory consumptions at the cost of some loss in performance. Moreover, probabilities
of quantized LMs are not supposed to be properly normalized.

\newpage
\section{LM Compilation}
LMs in ARPA, iARPA, and qARPA format can be stored in a compact binary table through the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.lm train.blm
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
which generates the binary file {\tt train.blm} that can be quickly loaded in memory.  If the LM
is really very large, {\tt compile-lm} can avoid to create the binary LM directly in memory through the 
option {\tt -memmap 1}, which exploits the {\em Memory Mapping} mechanism in order to work as 
much as possible on disk rather than in RAM. \\

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --memmap 1 train.lm train.blm
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This option clearly pays a fee  in terms of speed, but  is often the only way to proceed. It is also recommended 
that the hard disk for the LM storage belongs to the computer on which the compilation is performed.

\noindent
Notice that most of the functionalities of {\tt compile-lm} (see below) apply to binary and quantized models. 

\noindent
By default, the command uses the directory ``/tmp'' for storing
intermediate results.  For huge LMs, the temporary files can grow
dramatically causing a ``disk full'' system error.  It is possible to
explicitly set the directory used for temporary computation through the
parameter ``--tmpdir''.
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --tmpdir=<mytmpdir> train.lm train.blm
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Inverted order of ngrams}
\label{sec:inverted-lm}
For a faster access, the ngrams can be stored in inverted order with the following two commands:
\begin{verbatim}
$> sort-lm.pl -inv -ilm train.lm -olm train.inv.lm
$> compile-lm train.inv.lm train.inv.blm --invert yes
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Warning:} The following pipeline is no more allowed!!

\COMMENT{
or with the following pipeline:
}
\begin{verbatim}
$> cat train.lm | sort-lm.pl -inv | \
   compile-lm /dev/stdin train.inv.blm --invert yes
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\section{Filtering a LM}
A large LM can be filtered according to a word list through the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm  train.lm --filter list filtered.lm
\end{verbatim}
The resulting LM will only contain n-grams inside the provided list of words,
with the exception of the 1-gram level, which by default is preserved identical
to the original LM. This behavior can be changed by setting the option 
{\tt --keepunigrams no}.  LM filtering can be useful once very large LMs can
be specialized in advance to work on a particular portion of language.
\noindent
If the original LM is in binary format and is very large, {\tt compile-lm} can avoid to load it in memory,
through the memory mapping option {\tt -memmap 1}.







%%%% LM INTERFACE %%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{LM Interface}
LMs are useful when they can be queried through another application in order to compute 
perplexity scores or n-gram probabilities. {\IRSTLM} provides two possible interfaces: 
\begin{itemize}
\item at the command level, through  {\tt compile-lm}
\item at the c++ library level, mainly through methods of the class {\tt lmtable}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In the following, we will only focus on the command level interface. Details about
the c++ library interface will be provided in a future version of this manual.  

\subsection{Perplexity Computation}
Assume we have estimated and saved the following LM:

\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -o=train.lm -ps=no
 n=49984 LP=308057.0419 PP=474.9041687 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
To compute the perplexity directly from the LM on disk, we can use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.lm  --eval test
 %% Nw=49984 PP=1064.40 PPwp=589.50 Nbo=38071 Noov=2503 OOV=5.01%
\end{verbatim}
Notice that {\tt PPwp} reports the contribution of OOV words to the perplexity. Each OOV word is indeed penalized by dividing the
LM probability of the {\tt unk} word by  the quantity


\centerline{{\tt DictionaryUpperBound} - {\tt SizeOfDictionary}}

\noindent
The OOV penalty can be modify by changing the {\tt DictionaryUpperBound} with the parameter {\tt --dub} (whose default value is set to $10^7$). \\

\noindent
The perplexity of the pruned LM can be computed with the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.plm --eval test --dub 10000000
%% Nw=49984 PP=1019.69 PPwp=564.73 Nbo=39907 Noov=2503 OOV=5.01%
\end{verbatim}
Interestingly, a slightly better value is obtained which could be explained by the 
fact that pruning has removed many unfrequent trigrams and has redistributed 
their probabilities over more frequent bigrams.

\noindent
Notice that {\tt PPwp} reports the perplexity with a fixed dictionary upper-bound of 10 million words. Indeed:
\begin{verbatim}
$> tlm -tr=train.www -n=3 -lm=wb -te=test -o=train.lm -ps=no -dub=10000000 
n=49984 LP=348396.8632 PP=1064.401254 OVVRate=0.05007602433
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip
\noindent
Again, if the LM is in binary format and is very large, {\tt compile-lm} can avoid to load it in memory,
through the memory mapping option {\tt -memmap 1}.

\bigskip
\noindent
By enabling the option ``{\tt --sentence yes}'', {\tt compile-lm} computes perplexity and related figures (OOV rate, number of backoffs, etc.) for each input sentence. The end of a sentence is identified by a given symbol ({\tt </s>} by default).
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.plm --eval test --dub 10000000 --sentence yes	
\end{verbatim}
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
%% sent_Nw=1 sent_PP=23.22 sent_PPwp=0.00 sent_Nbo=0 sent_Noov=0 sent_OOV=0.00%
%% sent_Nw=8 sent_PP=7489.50 sent_PPwp=7356.27 sent_Nbo=7 sent_Noov=2 sent_OOV=25.00%
%% sent_Nw=9 sent_PP=1231.44 sent_PPwp=0.00 sent_Nbo=14 sent_Noov=0 sent_OOV=0.00%
%% sent_Nw=6 sent_PP=27759.10 sent_PPwp=25867.42 sent_Nbo=19 sent_Noov=1 sent_OOV=16.67%
.....
%% sent_Nw=5 sent_PP=378.38 sent_PPwp=0.00 sent_Nbo=39893 sent_Noov=0 sent_OOV=0.00%
%% sent_Nw=15 sent_PP=4300.44 sent_PPwp=2831.89 sent_Nbo=39907 sent_Noov=1 sent_OOV=6.67%
%% Nw=49984 PP=1019.69 PPwp=564.73 Nbo=39907 Noov=2503 OOV=5.01%
\end{verbatim}
}

\bigskip
\noindent
Finally, tracing information with the {\tt --eval }  option are shown by setting 
debug levels from 1 to 4 ({\tt --debug}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item reports the back-off level for each word
\item adds the log-prob 
\item adds the back-off weight
\item check if probabilities sum up to 1.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Probability Computations}
Word-by-word log-probabilities  can be computed as well from standard input with the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm train.lm --score yes < test

> </s>  1 p= NULL
> <s> <unk>     1 p= NULL
> <s> <unk> of  1 p= -3.530047e+00 bo= 2
> <unk> of the  1 p= -1.250668e+00 bo= 1
> of the senate 1 p= -1.170901e+01 bo= 1
> the senate (  1 p= -5.457265e+00 bo= 2
> senate ( <unk>        1 p= -2.166440e+01 bo= 2
....
....
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
the command reports the currently observed n-gram, 
including {\tt\_unk\_} words, a dummy
constant frequency 1, the log-probability of the n-gram, and the 
number of back-offs performed by the LM.  

\paragraph{Warning:} All cross-sentence $n$-grams are skipped. The 1-grams with the sentence start symbol are also skipped. In a $n$-grams all words before the sentence start symbol are removed. For $n$-grams, whose size is smaller than the LM order, probability is not computed, but a {\tt NULL} value is returned.


%%%% LM INTERPOLATION %%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{LM Interpolation}
We provide a convenient tool to estimate mixtures of LMs that have been already 
created in one of the available formats.  The tool permits to estimate interpolation
weights through the EM algorithm, to compute the perplexity, and to query the interpolated
LM. 

\noindent
Data used in those examples can be found in the directory {\tt example/interpolateLM/},
which represents the relative path for all the parameters of the referred commands.

\noindent
Interpolated LMs are defined by a configuration file in the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
3
0.3 lm-file1
0.3 lm-file2
0.4 lm-file3
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The first number indicates the number of LMs to be interpolated, then each LM is specified
by its weight and its file (either in ARPA or binary format). Notice that you can interpolate
LMs with different orders\\

\noindent
Given an initial configuration file {\tt lmlist.init} (with arbitrary weights), new weights can be estimated
through Expectation-Maximization on some text sample {\tt test} by running the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$> interpolate-lm lmlist.init --learn test
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
New weights will be written in the updated configuration file, called by default {\tt lmlist.init.out}.
You can also specify the name of the updated configuration file as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
$> interpolate-lm lmlist.init --learn test lmlist.final
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
Similarly to {\tt compile-lm}, interpolated LMs can be queried through the option {\tt --score}

\begin{verbatim}
$> interpolate-lm lmlist.final --score yes < test
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
and can return the perplexity of a given input text (``{\tt --eval text-file}''), optionally  at sentence level  by enabling the option ``{\tt --sentence yes}'',

\begin{verbatim}
$> interpolate-lm lmlist.final --eval test 
$> interpolate-lm lmlist.final --eval test --sentence yes
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip
\noindent
If there are binary LMs in the list,  {\tt interpolate-lm} can avoid to load them in memory through the memory 
mapping option {\tt -memmap 1}.


\noindent
The full list of options is:

\begin{verbatim}
--learn text-file   learn optimal interpolation for text-file
--order n           order of n-grams used in --learn (optional)
--eval text-file    compute perplexity on text-file
--dub dict-size     dictionary upper bound (default 10^7)
--score [yes|no]    compute log-probs of n-grams from stdin
--debug [1-3]       verbose output for --eval option (see compile-lm)
--sentence [yes|no] (compute perplexity at sentence level (identified
                    through the end symbol)
--memmap 1          use memory map to read a binary LM
\end{verbatim}
 

 
%%%% PARALLEL COMPUTATION %%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Parallel Computation}
This package provides facilities to build a gigantic LM in parallel in order to reduce computation time.
The script implementing this feature is based on the {\tt SUN Grid Engine} software\footnote{http://www.sun.com/software/gridware}.

\noindent
To apply the parallel computation run the following script (instead of {\tt build-lm.sh}):

\begin{verbatim}
$> build-lm-qsub.sh -i "gunzip -c train.gz" -n 3  -o train.ilm.gz -k 5
\end{verbatim}
Besides the options of {\tt build-lm.sh}, parameters for the SGE manager can be provided through the following one:

\begin{verbatim}
   -q      parameters for qsub, e.g. "-q <queue>", "-l <resources>"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The script performs the same {\em split-and-merge} policy described in Section~\ref{sec:giganticLM}, but some computation is performed in parallel (instead of sequentially) distributing the tasks on several machines.

%%%% CHUNK LM %%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Class and Chunk LMs}

{\IRSTLM} allows the use of class and chunk LMs, and a special
handling of input tokens which are concatenation of $N \ge 1$ fields separated
by the character \#, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
   word#lemma#part-of-speech#word-class
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The processing is guided by the format of the file passed to
Moses or {\tt compile-lm}: if it contains just the LM, either in textual or
binary format, it is treated as usual; otherwise, it is supposed to have
the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
LMMACRO <lmmacroSize> <selectedField> <collapse>
<lmfilename>
<mapfilename>
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where:
\begin{verbatim}
 LMMACRO is a reserved keyword
 <lmmacroSize> is a positive integer
 <selectedField> is an integer >=-1
 <collapse> is a boolean value (true, false)
 <lmfilename> is a file containing a LM (format compatible with {\IRSTLM})
 <mapfilename> is an (optional) file with a (one|many)-to-one map
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The various cases are discussed with examples in the
following. Data used in those examples can be found in the directory {\tt
example/chunkLM/} which represents the relative path for all the parameters
of the referred commands.  Note that texts with different tokens (words,
POS, word\#POS pairs...) used either as input or for training LMs are all
derived from the same multifield texts in order to allow direct comparison
of results.

\subsection{Field selection}

The simplest case is that of the LM in {\tt <lmfilename>} referring just to
one specific field of the input tokens. In this case, it is possible to
specify the field to be selected before querying the LM through the integer
{\tt <selectedField>} ($0$ for the first filed, $1$ for the
second...). With the value $-1$, no selection is applied and the LM is
queried with n-grams of whole strings.  The other parameters are set as:

\begin{verbatim}
 <lmmacroSize> : set to the size of the LM in <lmfilename>
 <collapse>    : false
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The third line optionally reserved to {\tt <mapfilename>} does not exist.

\bigskip
\noindent
Examples:

\bigskip
\noindent
\thesubsection.a) selection of the second field:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w-micro cfgfile/cfg.2ndfield
%% Nw=126 PP=2.68 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=0 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
\thesubsection.b) selection of the first field:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w-micro cfgfile/cfg.1stfield
%% Nw=126 PP=9.71 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=76 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The result of the latter case is identical to that obtained with
the standard configuration involving just words:

\bigskip
\noindent
\thesubsection.c) usual case on words:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w lm/train.en.blm 
%% Nw=126 PP=9.71 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=76 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Class LMs}

Possibly, a many-to-one or one-to-one map can be passed through the
{\tt <mapfilename>} parameter which has the simple format:

\begin{verbatim}
w1 class(w1)
w2 class(w2)
 ...
wM class(wM)
\end{verbatim}


\noindent The map is applied to each component of ngrams before the LM
query. Examples:
\bigskip

\noindent \thesubsection.a) map applied to the second field:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w-micro cfgfile/cfg.2ndfld-map
%% Nw=126 PP=16.40 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=33 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}



\noindent \thesubsection.b) just to assess the correctness of the (16.2.a) result:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.macro lm/train.macro.blm
%% Nw=126 PP=16.40 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=33 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%


\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Chunk LMs}

A particular processing is performed whenever fields are supposed to
correspond to microtags, i.e. the per-word projections of chunk labels. By
means of the {\tt <collapse>} parameter, it is possible to activate a
processing aiming at collapsing the sequence of microtags defining a
chunk. The chunk LM is then queried with ngrams of chunk labels, in an
asynchronous manner with respect to the sequence of words, as in general
chunks consist of more words.

\noindent
The collapsing operation is automatically activated if the sequence of
microtags is:

\begin{verbatim}
 TAG( TAG+ TAG+ ... TAG+ TAG)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Such a sequence is collapsed into a single chunk label (let us say {\tt
CHNK}) as long as {\tt TAG(}, {\tt TAG+} and {\tt TAG)} are all mapped into
the same label {\tt CHNK}. The map into different labels or a different
use/position of characters $($, $+$ and $)$ in the lexicon of tags prevent
the collapsing operation even if {\tt <collapse>} is set to {\tt true}. Of
course, if {\tt <collapse>} is {\tt false}, no collapse is attempted.

\paragraph{Warning:} In this context, it assumes an important role the parameter {\tt
<lmmacroSize>}: it defines the size of the n-gram before the collapsing
operation, that is the number of microtags of the actually processed
sequence. {\tt <lmmacroSize>} should be large enough to ensure that after
the collapsing operation, the resulting n-gram of chunks is at least of the
size of the LM to be queried (the {\tt <lmfilename>}). As an example,
assuming {\tt <lmmacroSize>=6}, {\tt <selectedField>=1}, {\tt
<collapse>=true} and 3 the size of the chunk LM, the following input

\begin{verbatim}
 on#PP average#NP( 30#NP+ -#NP+ 40#NP+ cm#NP)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent will yield to query the LM with just the bigram {\tt (PP,NP)},
instead of a more informative trigram; for this particular case, the value
6 for {\tt <lmmacroSize>} is not enough.  On the other side, for efficiency
reasons, it cannot be set to an unlimited valued. A reasonable value could
derive from the average number of microtags per chunk (2-3), which means
setting {\tt <lmmacroSize>} to two-three times the size of the LM in {\tt
<lmfilename>}.  Examples:
\bigskip

\noindent \thesubsection.a) second field, micro$\rightarrow$macro map, collapse:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w-micro cfgfile/cfg.2ndfld-map-cllps
%% Nw=126 PP=1.84 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=0 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%

$> compile-lm --eval test/test.w-micro cfgfile/cfg.2ndfld-map-cllps -d=1
%% Nw=126 PP=1.83774013 ... OOV=0.00% logPr=-33.29979642

\end{verbatim}

\noindent
\thesubsection.b) whole token,  micro$\rightarrow$macro map, collapse:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.micro cfgfile/cfg.token-map-cllps
%% Nw=126 PP=1.84 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=0 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
\thesubsection.c)  whole token,  micro$\rightarrow$macro map, NO collapse:
\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.micro cfgfile/cfg.token-map
%% Nw=126 PP=16.40 PPwp=0.00 Nbo=0 Noov=0 OOV=0.00%
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Note that the configuration (16.3.c) gives the same result of that in
example (16.2.b), as they are equivalent.

\bigskip
\noindent
\thesubsection.d) As an actual example related to the ``warning'' note
reported above, the following configuration with usual LM:

\begin{verbatim}
$> compile-lm --eval test/test.chunk lm/train.macro.blm -d=1
Nw=73 PP=2.85754443 ... OOV=0.00000000% logPr=-33.28748842
\end{verbatim}

\noindent not necessarily yields the same log-likelihood ({\tt logPr}) nor the same perplexity ({\tt PP}) of case (16.3.a).
In fact, concerning {\tt PP}, the length of the input sequence is definitely different (126 tokens before collapsing, 73 after that).
Even the {\tt logPr} is different (-33.29979642 vs. -33.28748842) because in (16.3.a) some 6-grams ({\tt
<lmmacroSize>} is set to 6) after collapsing reduce to $n$-grams of size less
than 3 (the size of lm/train.macro.blm). By setting {\tt <lmmacroSize>} to
a larger value (e.g. 8), the same {\tt logPr} will be computed.
